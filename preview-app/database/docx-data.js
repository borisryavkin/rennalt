Our state-of-the-art technology empowers fitness centres, wellness facilities, and healthcare providers to deliver personalized services, enhance client engagement, and drive business growth.\nBelow is an image of one of our kiosks in use\nFounded in 2015 by Ed Zouroudis and Kelly Weideman, Evolt 360 is a pioneering wellness technology company headquartered in Southport, Queensland, Australia, but with offices also in Charlston, South Carolina in the USA. The company specializes in body composition analysis and digital health solutions, offering a comprehensive ecosystem that empowers individuals and organizations to track, understand, and improve health outcomes. The Evolt 360 is not a weight scale. It is the tool, that empowers you to dive deep into how and where your body is changing as you strive to meet your wellness goals. We provide you the data that informs decisions and inspires you to keep striving to be your best\nMission: To educate people with meaningful insights into their body composition, turning information into inspiration for healthier living.\nVision: To become the most trusted provider in the wellness industry by evolving body composition intelligence and delivering a connected health experience.\nEvolt 360\u2019s platform includes:\nAdvanced body composition scanners (The kiosk)\nA mobile app for personalized health tracking\nData analytics tools for health professionals and fitness businesses (Insights Platform)\nIntegration with gamified social environments to encourage engagement and accountability\nOur technology enables users to monitor changes in body composition, activity levels, nutrition, and overall health with precision and ease.\nOperating within the Digital Health and HealthTech sectors, Evolt 360 has grown steadily, now employing over 40 staff and serving thousands of partners globally. Our prime industry vertical is Fitness. Here we are fortunate to have global agreements with some of the world\u2019s most premium brands, including Anytime Fitness, Worlds Gym, Goodlife and many more\nEvolt has received industry recognition for its innovative approach to health monitoring and continues to expand its global footprint in fitness centres, wellness clinics, and corporate health programs. This includes recently being named Health and Wellness Technology company of the year. An award voted on by the industry\nWhile Evolt offers a hardware solution, our core strength lies in being a software and is a data company, which sets us apart in the market. From our humble beginnings, we have grown significantly and are set to list on the Australian Stock Exchange in 2025. This milestone marks the beginning of a new era for Evolt, as we aim to explore new markets and industry verticals with a renewed focus on delivering market leading customer value.\nAt Evolt, when we refer to \"the customer,\" we mean the thousands of facilities that have purchased an Evolt Kiosk. Our goal is to partner with these facilities to help grow their businesses by integrating our technology into their service ecosystems. These facilities, in turn, serve their own customers, assisting them in achieving their health goals, these are our end users. Our objective is to collect, analyse, and provide actionable data that enhances decision-making for both our customers and their end users\nCONTEXT\nThe current Evolt apps have passed through a few developers hands, both in-house and Vendor over our 10 year history. The code is a challenge to maintain and test. We have a roadmap which includes a complete transformation of our code base. But for now we are challenged by an ecosystem that is robust, but has its unique behaviours that are frustrating to the Technology/Support team within Evolt and our user base\nTo that end, Evolt is seeking to leverage the experience of a new partner. A partner that is an industry leader, whose experience we can tap into, to accelerate our own capabilities as a business.\nIn seeking to work with ASTA we are not looking for \u201cresources\u201d that we need to manage. Rather we are seeking a partner, who can take responsibility and deliver an outcome. As a global company, the location of technical resources is not our concern, it is the outcome we are seeking. We are seeking a partner that does not require micromanaging, is proactive with suggestions and improvements, is agile and can genuinely take work away for the existing stretched for capacity workforce. We require a partner who is part of our inhouse team, who is passionate about our customers as they will be the face of Evolt in a large way\nAs a scale-up business, Evolt 360 has been intensely focused on product development and innovation. Like many companies in this phase, comprehensive documentation has not always kept pace with our technical progress.\nOne of the key strengths of the Evolt\u2013ASTA partnership will be ASTA\u2019s role in learning, creating, and enhancing documentation to deepen our shared knowledge base. This collaboration will help us build a more structured and accessible foundation for both internal teams and external stakeholders.\nWe are committed to developing documentation that is clear, simple, and easy to follow. In the near future, our goal is to transform our current internal knowledge base into a customer-facing resource that empowers greater self-service and reduces support dependency.\nAt present, however, the maturity of our documentation is not yet at the level required for public release. This partnership marks a pivotal step toward bridging that gap and delivering a more scalable and user-friendly support experience and result in the first co-created product between ASTA and Evolt\nArchitecture\nASTA Scope\nThe ASTA support services are specifically focused on the following components of the Evolt ecosystem:\nNative and Web Mobile Applications\nEvolt Kiosk Frontend and Control Panel Software\nDesignated Sections of the Insights Platform\nRead-Only Customer Credential Validation\nThe following areas are not included within the scope of ASTA services:\nSupport for the Evolt AWS hosting environment\nMaintenance or troubleshooting of the Kiosk operating system\nUpdating customer or user details via the Insights platform\nApplication Description\nEvolt\u2019s ecosystem is built around three primary products:\nEvolt Kiosk \u2013 Our primary data collection device\nInsights Analytics Platform \u2013 A powerful reporting and engagement tool for gyms\nMobile Applications \u2013 Available on iOS, Android, and Web\nMobile App\nThe Evolt mobile apps provide users with a comprehensive wellness experience. Key functionalities include:\nAccount creation and modification\nWellness goal setting\nInput of essential data (e.g., height) not captured by the Kiosk\nAccess to detailed scan results and educational insights\nHistorical scan data and trend visualization\nCustom supplement and workout recommendations\nAccess to Evolt\u2019s range of supplements and pre-prepared meals (for participating franchises)\nEvolt Kiosk\nThe Kiosk is Evolt\u2019s primary data source, capturing over 80 unique data points per scan. While Evolt is a software-first company, the Kiosk hardware is a calibrated, medical-grade device.\nCustomization\nSome customers use custom interfaces (rare) or custom results sheets (more common).\nASTA does not need to be deeply familiar with custom interfaces, as they are stable and rarely generate support tickets.\nIssues with custom results sheets are often linked to the Kiosk print process. Diagnosing whether this process is running typically resolves related issues via the Knowledge base article .\nThird-Party Integrations\neGym Integration requires:\nNFC/QR reader connected before boot\nAPI key issued by Evolt\nMember association via eGym\nMatching email between Evolt and eGym accountsMore details are available in the Knowledge Base.\nConnectivity\nKiosks support Wi-Fi but Ethernet is preferred due to reliability.\nPoor Wi-Fi can cause scan interruptions or database corruption, leading to issues such as the WhiteScreen error. Refer to the Knowledge Base for troubleshooting.\nHardware Considerations\nThe Kiosk must be placed on a flat surface with stable power.\nFluctuating power or uneven placement can damage internal components. These hardware faults are often linked to poor power sources and are difficult to diagnose. See the Knowledge Base for guidance.\nInsights Platform\nInsights is Evolt\u2019s analytics and engagement platform for gym owners. It provides:\nAdvanced reporting tools to track member progress\nScientific validation of gym success through scan data\nChallenge management, including global competitions with significant prizes\nIntegration with Evolt\u2019s affiliate program for supplements and meals, enabling profit-sharing opportunities for gyms\nInsights Admin\nInsights Admin is a separate platform used for:\nUser and Kiosk account creation\nAPI key management\nASTA will have read-only access to Insights Admin and will not be able to make changes.\nASTA Support Scope\nNative and Web Mobile Applications\nEvolt Kiosk Frontend and Control Panel\nDesignated sections of the Insights platform\nRead-only customer credential validation with Insights Admin\nOut of Scope\nEvolt AWS hosting environment\nKiosk operating system\nUpdating customer or user details via Insights\nStructure\nInsights Team\nThe Evolt Insights Team is responsible for managing and supporting key components of the Insights Platform.

While Wi-Fi connectivity is supported, it is provided on a best-effort basis only.\nKey Considerations\nReliability: Ethernet offers a more stable and consistent connection, which is essential for optimal kiosk performance.\nTroubleshooting: If a kiosk is experiencing connectivity issues while on Wi-Fi, we recommend relocating it temporarily to a location where it can be connected via Ethernet. If the issues are resolved without any configuration changes, the root cause is likely related to Wi-Fi.\nKnown Wi-Fi Limitations\nDatabase Corruption: In some cases, high-latency Wi-Fi environments have caused database corruption within the kiosk, resulting in a \u201cwhite screen\u201d error.\nSignal Strength vs. Coverage: Even if the site has strong overall internet connectivity, the radio signal strength at the kiosk\u2019s physical location may be weak. This can lead to poor or intermittent connectivity.\nSolution: Try relocating the kiosk closer to a Wi-Fi access point to improve signal strength and stability.\nSummary\nFor best performance and to minimize support issues:\nUse Ethernet whenever possible\nUse Wi-Fi only when Ethernet is not feasible, and be aware of its limitations\nRelocate the kiosk for testing if Wi-Fi issues are suspected\nPush back on sites where Wi-Fi is proving to be a barrier to support, until the Kiosk can be relocated to a position where Ethernet is present.

If the scale is not working, you will see 0.00kg when the machine is stood on.\nPlease also get a photo of the handles and wires and its common for wires to be exposed which in turn means the scale isn't working and the current is not going through\nChange Scale ModeSwitch the scale mode from Precision to Normal, or vice versa.\nCalibrate the scale through control panel settings- click on scale, then calibrate in top right-hand corner, then hit save\nUpdate the SoftwareCheck for and install any available software updates.\nTry a different PowerPoint on a different side of the gym (different powerline)\nEscalate to Level 2 SupportIf none of the above steps resolve the issue, escalate to Level 2 for further investigation or hardware servicing. If the issue persists after completing the above steps, escalate the case to Level 2 Support for further diagnosis and resolution. Please reply to customer saying that this has been escalated to level 2 and they will require new parts. In the email, please include whether customer is in warranty or not. In a separate issue forward the HubSpot ticket to level 2\nLevel 2 will communicate with regional manager of the required part(s) for the repair and with approval ship parts either directly to the gym or to the technician to complete the repair.\nOnce machine is repaired level 2 organise the return of the faulty parts. They then will see whether customer was in warranty or not.

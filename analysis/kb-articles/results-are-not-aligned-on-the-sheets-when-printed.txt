Results are not aligned on the sheets when printed

  
    
This issue may occur if the incorrect printer model was selected during setup or if the printer is connected wirelessly to the scanner.

   
Begin by checking how your printer is connected to your scanner.

If the printer is connected wirelessly

While connecting wirelessly is an option, it is not advisable due to potential disconnection issues between the printer and scanner. This can lead to the printer inadvertently selecting a different model upon reconnecting to the internet, resulting in alignment issues with printed result sheets.

 

If this happens we would need to delete and reconnect the printer to the scanner

Make sure that the printer and scanner are connected to the same network.

Delete all printers on the list then Add printer

From the ‘Add Printer’ screen, locate the section of printers listed ‘discovered network printers’, select the Brother HL-L2370DW series option and hit continue then follow the next steps on how to connect the printer to the scanner correctly

 

If the printer is connected via cable

It is strongly advised to utilize the provided cable to ensure a direct connection between the printer and scanner. The USB A port should be plugged into one of the four USB ports behind the Display screen, while the USB B port should be plugged in to the printer.

 

If the connection is correct, then follow the next steps on how to connect the printer to the scanner correctly

 

If all steps above are followed; you may need to adjust the print position on the printer itself.

Adjust the “Print position” in the printer settings.

Press the “OK” button on the printer and navigate to:

Printer -> Print Position -> Y offset

The Y offset moves the print start position (at the upper left corner of pages) vertically up to -500 (up) to +500 (down) dots in 300 dpi units.

The X offset moves the print start position (at the upper left corner of pages) horizontally up to -500 (left) to +500 (right) dots in 300 dpi units.

Press the printer arrow keys in order to increase or decrease the Y offset Up or Down, an the X axis Left or Right and then confirm by pressing the Ok button.

It may take a couple of adjustments in order to center the white text box in the result sheet, but from what we experienced we recommend trying to shift the Y offset down by about 20/25 points.

Age of Consent/ Data Protection for Minors

  
    
Age of Consent in relation to Data Privacy varies per Country and State you are in.

   
Q1: Why is data security and privacy so important when using the Evolt
360?
A1: Data security and privacy are fundamental to Evolt's global operations. We
ensure compliance with privacy legislation worldwide, safeguarding all user
data, particularly for users who are legally deemed “underage.” This includes
anonymizing underage data in the Evolt Insights platform to protect privacy
and meet legal requirements.

Q2: What does Evolt do to comply with the Age of Consent in different
jurisdictions?
A2: Evolt adheres to the legal age of consent as per jurisdictional requirements.
Our robust process includes –
 Anonymizing all data for underage users in Evolt Insights.
 Allowing underage users to scan and access their printed results, but
ensuring no personal data is identifiable in Insights.
 Defaulting the age of consent to 18 for users outside predefined regions
with lower age limits.

Q3: What is the age of consent categories Evolt recognizes globally?
A3: The minimum age of consent depends on the jurisdiction -
 Age 16 - United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan, Antigua and Barbuda,
Albania, Armenia, Angola, Argentina, Austria, Azerbaijan, and U.S. states
such as California and Connecticut.
 Age 13 - U.S. states such as Colorado, Utah, and Virginia.
 Age 18 (Default) - Applies to users from regions not listed above.

 

Q4: Can children participate in challenges using the Evolt 360?
A4: Yes, children can participate in challenges, but privacy measures are strictly
upheld -
 Children can scan and see their individual printed results.
 Insights anonymizes all underage data, so individual winners cannot be
identified.
 Organizers can access aggregated group data (e.g., totals and averages)
for analysis.

Q5: Can individual data for underage users be accessed or shared?
A5: No, underage user data in Evolt Insights is anonymized and cannot be traced
back to individuals. This ensures compliance with privacy legislation and
protects underage users privacy.

 

Q6: What steps should operators take to comply with age of consent laws?
A6: Operators should -
1. Verify the user’s jurisdiction and determine the applicable age of consent.
2. Allow underage users access to printed scan results only.
3. Communicate clearly with customers about privacy and compliance rules.

Q7: Why can’t there be individual winners in challenges for underage users?
A7: To protect the privacy of underage users and comply with anonymization laws,
Evolt Insights does not allow individual identification of underage users in
reports. Organizers can only access group-level aggregated data.

 

Q8: How does Evolt handle anonymization for underage users?
A8: For underage users, the Evolt Insights platform anonymizes all personal data.
This process ensures compliance with global privacy laws while allowing
users to see their individual scan results. No identifiable data is stored or
accessible in Insights for these users.

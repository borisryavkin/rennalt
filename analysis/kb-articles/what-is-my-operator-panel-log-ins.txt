What is my Operator Panel log in?

   
This is a specific log in to your machine in order for your to run a scan. We attached a black sticker that contains the email address and password at the back of your Evolt Scanner. Take note that it is not an active email address but it is created only to be used to log in to your Evolt Active Scanner.

If you cannot see the sticker at the back of your scanner that contains this information, kindly send us email or contact support for assistance.

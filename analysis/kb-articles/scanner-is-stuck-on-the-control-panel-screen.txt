The scanner is stuck on the Control Panel screen

  
    
I am having trouble initiating a scan and navigating past the control panel screen

   

Ensure that the scanner is connected to the Internet and displaying 'Online' in green at the bottom center of the Control Panel screen

Press the green 'Operator Panel' button

Enter the Operator Panel Logins (located on a black sticker at the back of the Evolt scanner)

Refer to the following Operator Configuration:

              Location  - Select your location from the drop down menu
              Kiosk mode - Must always be set as unattended
              Printer - Choose between manual or automatic printing for each scan.
              Volume - Adjust the volume to suit your environment. We usually set it at 25

Click on the "Save" button to apply the changes

Begin the scanning process by pressing the red 'Start Scanning' button

Connecting the Evolt 360 to the Internet
Issue : How do I connect the Evolt 360 Body Scanner to the
internet


Connecting the Kiosk to a Network

To check or set up your kiosk’s network connection, follow these steps:

   1. Tap the Evolt logo in the top left corner of the Log In / Sign Up screen to access the
      Control Panel.
   2. Select Network from the menu.

For Ethernet Connection:

   •    Ensure the Ethernet cable is securely plugged into the port behind the kiosk screen and into
        an active internet port at your facility.
   •    The Ethernet section should display “100 connected” if the connection is successful.
   •    Evolt strongly recommends using an Ethernet cable for the most stable and reliable
        connection, especially in environments with inconsistent Wi-Fi coverage.

For Wi-Fi Connection:

   3. Make sure Wi-Fi is turned ON.
   4. Remove any unknown or outdated network profiles from the list.
   5. Tap New Connection and select your preferred network.
   6. Enter the correct Wi-Fi password when prompted.
   7. To confirm a successful connection, look for “100 connected” or “Online” in green text at
      the bottom center of the screen.
   8. Please note: If your kiosk is connected via Wi-Fi, Evolt may be limited in the support it can
      provide, particularly if issues are related to network stability or performance.

Software Update
Issue: I want to download the newest version of the software to
correct any software bugs and to remain up to date with the
latest from Evolt

To perform a software update on your Evolt Kiosk, follow these steps:

   1. Tap the Evolt logo in the top left corner of the screen to access the Control Panel.
   2. Ensure the kiosk is connected to the internet. You should see a green “Online” status at the
      bottom center of the screen.
   3. Once connected, select the Software Update button to begin the update process.

The update will start automatically and typically takes 3–4 minutes, depending on your internet
speed. After the update begins, allow 2–3 minutes for the screen to transition. Once the new
scanning screen appears, the kiosk is ready for use.

Important: Regular software updates are essential to ensure your kiosk is running the latest features
from Evolt and remains free of bugs or performance issues. Keeping your software up to date helps
maintain optimal functionality and user experience.
                                                                     http://www.evolt360.com/



The scanner is stuck on a white screen
Issue: The Kiosk screen is all White.
Troubleshooting a White Screen on the Evolt Kiosk

If your kiosk displays a white screen, follow these steps:

    1. Restart the kiosk.
    2. If the kiosk returns to the Control Panel, re-establish the network connection.
    3. Once connected to the internet, attempt to run a software update

If the kiosk remains stuck on the white screen:

    •   Wait 10 minutes to allow the system’s recovery process to attempt a reboot to its last saved
        operational state.
    •   If the screen does not return to the Control Panel after this time, please contact Evolt
        Support or submit a support ticket for further assistance.

Note: A white screen typically indicates that the kiosk has detected a corruption in its software or
database. During this time, the kiosk is attempting to recover a backup version of its system.

Important: Frequent white screens may be a sign of insufficient internet speed or unstable
connectivity. If your kiosk is currently connected via Wi-Fi, Evolt strongly recommends switching
to a wired Ethernet connection for improved stability and performance. This also ensures better
support and reduces the likelihood of recurring issues.

If the kiosk restarts and remains on a white screen with no other screens displayed:

This indicates that the kiosk was unable to recover from the issue and requires a software base
image reset. This process must be performed by the Evolt Support Team and will require:

    •   A USB drive
    •   A wired keyboard and mouse

No option to add 'NEW CONNECTION'
Issue: There is no option to connect to our WiFi
If your kiosk is not detecting the Wi-Fi dongle, please follow these steps:

    1. Ensure the Wi-Fi dongle is securely connected to one of the USB ports located behind the
       display.
    2. Tap the Evolt logo in the top left corner of the Log In / Sign Up screen to access the
       Control Panel.
    3. Select System and check if USB Lock is turned ON.
    4. If USB Lock is ON:
            o Switch it OFF.
            o Return to the Control Panel and restart the kiosk.
            o After restarting, go back to System to confirm that USB Lock remains OFF.
    5. If USB Lock is already OFF, perform a power cycle (turn the kiosk off and back on) to apply
       the setting.
    6. After restarting, go to the Network section in the Control Panel and check if the ‘New
       Connection’ button is now visible.
    7. If the ‘New Connection’ button is still not visible:
            o Test the dongle by connecting it to another device to confirm it is functioning
                properly.
    8. If the dongle is working, try performing a Software Update using a wired Ethernet
       connection.
    9. If the issue persists, please contact Evolt Support for further assistance.

Cannot Find Customers Detail
Issue: When trying to logon to the kiosk the customers details
cannot be found

Things to Check When a Customer is Experiencing Login Issues

   1. Check for Special Characters in the Mobile Number
         o Does the customer’s mobile or cell number include special characters (e.g. +, !, $,
              etc.)?
                   § If yes, ask the customer to log in to the Evolt Active App and update their
                     phone number by removing any special characters.
                   § Alternatively, you can contact Evolt Support to assist with removing the           Commented [ES1]: @Chris Simpfendorfer might be better
                                                                                                        for insights to be listed as the POC since we cannot edit the
                     special characters.                                                                phone number
   2. Verify the Mobile Number Matches the One Used During Account Creation
         o If the number doesn’t match:
                   § Ask the customer to log in to the Evolt Active App and update their phone
                     number.
                   § Or, contact Evolt Support to request a password reset.
                   § If you're unsure, it's best to start by having the customer update their details
                     in the app.
   3. Confirm the Customer Has an Active Account
         o Customers can delete their account from within the Evolt Active App.
         o If the account has been deleted or you're unsure of its status, please contact Evolt
              Support to check and, if needed, re-enable the account.                                   Commented [ES2]: Are we steering away from the need for
                                                                                                        a privacy web form if we can over phone/email confirm they

Frozen Kiosk Screen
Issue: When trying push any of the buttons on the kiosk, none
seem to work

Troubleshooting Steps:

   1. Check for Attended Mode:
           o Tap the Evolt logo located in the top left corner of the screen.
           o If this opens the control panel, your kiosk is likely in Attended Mode.                  Commented [ES3]: Should be Partner Mode
           o Look for a small circle in the top right corner of the screen. Tap it, and you’ll be
              prompted to enter a password.
           o Please contact your Company Champion to obtain the password.
           o Once entered, the kiosk should return to normal functionality, allowing you to use all
              buttons as expected.
   2. If the Evolt logo does not respond:
           o Log out of your Operator Panel and then re-log into the Operator Panel
           o If this does not fix the issue; Power off the kiosk.                                     Commented [ES4]: First step normally to resolve is have
                                                                                                      them log out of the Operator Panel and then log back in
           o Wait for 10 seconds, then power it back on.
           o If the issue persists after restarting, please reach out to Evolt Support for further
              assistance.




To change your kiosk from Attended Mode to Unattended Mode, please follow these steps:

   1.   Tap the Evolt logo in the top left corner of the screen to access the control panel.
   2.   Navigate to the Operator Panel.
   3.   Re-enter your login credentials when prompted.
   4.   Select Unattended Mode from the available options.

Once completed, your kiosk will return to standard operation, allowing users to interact with it as   Commented [ES5]: This does not turn off the pincode
usual.                                                                                                "partner mode". this needs to be done by our side.

                                                                                                      Attended mode keeps the scanner on the Control Panel and
                                                                                                      forces them to login to the Operator Panel for every scan.
                                                                                                      Partner mode basically saves the email and only requires the

Kiosk did not complete a scan
Issue: When doing a scan, the scan screen freezes before
completing

Kiosk Internet Connectivity and Scan Freezing Issue

The Evolt Kiosk is designed to function without an internet connection. However, certain parts of the
scanning process do rely on connectivity. In particular, we’ve observed that at locations with weak or
unstable Wi-Fi, a scan may begin successfully but fail when attempting to upload data to the Evolt
Cloud. This can cause the kiosk to appear unresponsive or “frozen.”

What to Do:

   1. Restart the Kiosk to reset the system.
   2. Check the internet connection—look for the small green text at the bottom of the screen. It
      should say “Online.”
   3. Once the kiosk is confirmed to be online, re-perform the scan.

Maintaining a stable internet connection throughout the scanning process helps ensure smooth
operation and data upload. Where ever possible have an Evolt Kiosk plugged into a data cable
(ethernet)
                                                                       http://www.evolt360.com/



I cannot print or access Wi-Fi
Issue: I know Wi-Fi is working at our Gym, but I still cannot get
onto the Wi-Fi .Or. I know my printer which is connected to my
Kiosk via a USB cable is all working, but it will not print


USB Lock Feature on the Evolt Kiosk

The Evolt Kiosk is a medical-grade device, and when used in clinical or healthcare environments,
regulatory requirements may prohibit the use of external USB devices. To comply with these
standards, Evolt includes a USB Lock feature that disables USB ports on the kiosk.

Occasionally, this feature may be accidentally triggered or enabled.

To disable USB Lock:

   1.   Tap the Evolt logo in the top left corner to access the Control Panel.
   2.   Navigate to System Settings.
   3.   Locate the USB Lock option and switch it to Off.
   4.   Close the settings page.
   5.   Restart the kiosk—please note that the change will only take effect after the kiosk has been
        restarted.

Check Printer Settings:

   1. Tap the EVOLT logo in the left hand corner
   2. Log into the Operator Panel using your machine logins
   3. Check the Print setting is not set to “OFF”; setting should be set to Manual of Auto
   4. From the Control Panel; ensure the printer you are using is set to the “Server Default”
           a. Select Printers from the Control Panel
           b. Select your Printer and the press the green “Set as Server Default" button
   5. If the issue of not printing persists contact EVOLT Support

Weight not showing correctly
Issue: The customers weight is more than it should be, the scale
does not appear correct
Adjusting Clothing Weight and Calibrating the Evolt Scale

The Evolt Kiosk scale includes a feature that allows you to account for the estimated weight of
clothing worn by customers. This setting is fully customizable via the Control Panel.

To adjust the clothing weight setting:

    1. Tap the Evolt logo in the top left corner to open the Control Panel.
    2. Select Scale from the menu.
    3. In the bottom left corner of the screen, you’ll find a field where you can set the estimated
       clothing weight.

Evolt recommends setting this as a “set and forget” value—an approximate weight that remains
consistent for all users. For most gym environments, a setting of 0.5 kg /1.1lbs is typically suitable.

If the scale readings still seem off:

    •   On the same screen, press the Calibrate button. This will initiate a system check and reset
        the kiosk’s weight sensors, which can occasionally fall out of calibration.

Here’s a professional and friendly rewrite of your message:




If the scale readings still seem off:

    1. Tap the Evolt logo in the top left corner of the Log In / Sign Up screen to access the
       Control Panel.
    2. Select the Scale option—ensure no one is standing on the scale during this process.
    3. Confirm the following settings:
           o Scale Mode: Metric or Imperial (based on your preference)
           o Abdominal Circumference: ON
                                                                      http://www.evolt360.com/


           o   Abdominal Obesity Over 18: ON
          o Measurement Mode: PRECISION
          o Weight of Clothes: 0.5 kg (or 1.1 lbs)
          o Scale Weight: 0.00
   4. Press the Calibrate button, then select Save to apply the changes.
   5. Tap the red Start Scanning button to return to the Log In / Sign Up screen.
   6. To test the scale:
          o Choose Weight Only Measurement to check accuracy, or
          o Log in and complete a full scan to compare results.

Connection to the Internet Lost
Issue: I know we still have WiFi but I cannot connect the Kiosk
to the internet

Checking Kiosk Connectivity

If your Evolt Kiosk is experiencing connectivity issues, try the following steps:

    1. Connect via Ethernet:
          o If possible, plug the kiosk directly into a data cable (Ethernet) to establish a stable
             connection.
    2. Use Mobile Tethering:
          o If Ethernet is not available, temporarily tether your mobile phone to the kiosk to
             provide internet access.

If either method restores connectivity, the kiosk is functioning correctly. For ongoing network
support or setup assistance, please consult your local IT team.
                                                                       http://www.evolt360.com/



The red button to start scanning is not there
Issue: I cannot see the red button on the control panel to start
scanning. Or the kiosk has started up and is stuck on the control
panel page


Red “Start Scanning” Button Not Appearing

If the red Start Scanning button is missing, it may indicate that the kiosk is not currently logged in.

To resolve this:

    1. Open the Operator Panel from the Control Panel.
    2. Enter your kiosk’s unique login credentials.
    3. If the Start Scanning button does not appear; press the “Refresh” button which should bring
       you to your Home screen

Note: These are not your personal login details—each kiosk has its own specific login.

Once the correct credentials are entered, the red Start Scanning button should appear, and the
kiosk will be ready for use.




Additional Note: If the Start Scanning button does not appear and you notice that the Scale API
status is going from connected to disconnected; please contact EVOLT Support.
                                                                       http://www.evolt360.com/



Why do I need to relogging to the Kiosk
Issue: Every couple of weeks I have to restart the kiosk and
login again
Security Settings Update Required

The Evolt Kiosk includes a security feature that occasionally requires its connection settings to the
Evolt Cloud to be refreshed or updated.

To complete this update:

    1. Restart the kiosk.
    2. Once restarted, re-enter the kiosk’s login credentials to restore its connection.

This process ensures the kiosk maintains secure and reliable communication with the Evolt Cloud.
                                                                       http://www.evolt360.com/



My eGym login is not working
Issue: When I try to use my eGym wrist band, or card, or my
mobile phone to login to the Evolt Kiosk the kiosk just beeps
and does nothing else

Troubleshooting Card Reader Connection on the Evolt Kiosk

If your card reader is not functioning, please follow these steps:

    1. Check the USB Connection:
          o Ensure the card reader is securely plugged into one of the kiosk’s USB ports.
          o For best results, unplug and replug the reader to confirm a solid connection.
          o After reconnecting the reader, restart the kiosk.
    2. Verify Connection in the Control Panel:
          o Tap the Evolt logo in the top left corner of the Log In / Sign Up screen to access the
               Control Panel.
          o On the right-hand side of the screen, look for the status message “Card Reader
               Connected.”
          o If this message does not appear, the card reader may not be properly connected or
               recognized.
    3. Check eGym Credentials:
          o Ensure that your eGym credentials are current and valid, as outdated credentials

No Red Start Scanning Button
Issue: When I turn the kiosk on, it does not go to the start
scanning screen. On the Control Pannel screen the red “start
scanning” button is not there

Troubleshooting Steps

If you're experiencing this issue with your Kiosk, please follow the steps below:

    1. Check Connectivity
       Look at the bottom center of the screen. If the Kiosk is online, you’ll see small green text that
       says “Online.”
    2. Reconnect to the Network
       If the Kiosk is not online, go to Network Settings and connect to either Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
    3. If the kiosk is still not displaying the Red “start scanning” button, press refresh. If it still does
       not appear, Log In Again
            o Open the Operator Panel
            o Enter the Kiosk login credentials
            o Once logged in, return to the Control Panel Home Page and press Refresh
    4. Restart the Kiosk
       If logging in doesn’t resolve the issue, try restarting the Kiosk by powering it off and then
       back on.
    5. Contact Support
       If the issue persists after restarting, please reach out to Evolt Support for further assistance.
